AttendEase aims to revolutionize the traditional method of taking attendance by developing a web-based application that streamlines the process for all parties involved. It prioritizes accuracy, security, and efficiency, addressing common challenges such as proxy attendance and manual data entry errors. By leveraging biometric authentication, two-factor authentication, and other advanced security measures, AttendEase ensures the integrity and authenticity of attendance records. Additionally, the application provides transparency and accountability through blockchain-based timestamping and immutable records, offering verifiable proof of an individual's presence. Ultimately, AttendEase aims to enhance engagement and foster a culture of integrity and accountability within various sectors.
